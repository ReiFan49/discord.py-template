# Discord Bot Python Template

Simple project layout for starting a Discord Bot through Python, supports Docker as well.

Dockerfile is based from [gorialis' discord.py image](https://hub.docker.com/r/gorialis/discord.py).
Feel free to adjust the Dockerfile to fit your needs.
This Dockerfile provides a lightweight image that acts as a superset of gorialis' build which excludes Voice-related libraries.
